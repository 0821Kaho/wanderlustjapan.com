Children aged around five and above can join with a guardian.\n- **Historical Significance**: Train in an area once bordering the powerful Hojo and Takeda clans during the Sengoku period—an authentic “shinobi village.”\n- **Flexible Program**: A two-hour plan (including time for changing clothes and Q&A), starting any time between 10:00 and 15:00. By request, certain aspects—like breathing methods, walking techniques, or Kuji meditation—can be emphasized.\n\n**Includes**\n- Ninja training fee\n- Insurance\n- Ninja attire (on request, subject to size availability)\n\n**Schedule**\n1.
