    description: "Mount Kintoki, the highest peak of Hakone outer rim, is a popular hiking destination—and it happens to be our most sought-after tour. We tailor the pace to each participant, paying close attention to weather conditions and answering all your mountain hiking questions. While the ridgeline from Mount Kintoki to Otome Pass offers the most substantial challenge, we can also arrange shorter routes, such as a round trip from Kintoki Shrine, depending on your preference. After leaving Kintoki Shrine, you’ll pass by the legendary boulder said to have sheltered the folk hero Kintaro from the evening dew. You can spot azaleas, Japanese andromeda, cherry blossoms, and beech trees. In spring, look for violets; in autumn, watch for the Matsumushiso bloom. Enjoy a rest at the mountaintop hut, where you can buy udon (around 1,000 yen). On hot days, you might even find ice pops! On clear days, Mt. Fuji stands directly before you—a major draw for many hikers. In autumn and winter, there’s a good chance of seeing its iconic snowcapped peak. You may also catch glimpses of Sagami Bay and Suruga Bay. Feast your eyes on Owakudani’s billowing volcanic steam and take in sweeping views of Hakone’s central crater hills and Lake Ashi.",

Children aged around five and above can join with a guardian.\n- **Historical Significance**: Train in an area once bordering the powerful Hojo and Takeda clans during the Sengoku period—an authentic “shinobi village.”\n- **Flexible Program**: A two-hour plan (including time for changing clothes and Q&A), starting any time between 10:00 and 15:00. By request, certain aspects—like breathing methods, walking techniques, or Kuji meditation—can be emphasized.\n\n**Includes**\n- Ninja training fee\n- Insurance\n- Ninja attire (on request, subject to size availability)\n\n**Schedule**\n1.

Limited parking (1 space) available.\n\n**Duration**\n1.5–2 hours (approx.)\n\n**What to Bring**\n- Comfortable clothing and footwear\n- Ninja attire is available for rent or purchase upon request (sizes are limited)\n\n**Important Notes**\n- Reservation is by request only; please contact us first to confirm availability.\n- If the desired date cannot be accommodated, we will advise alternative dates.\n- Due to the presence of valuable items on the premises, small children and pets are not allowed without proper supervision.\n\nJoin us for an exclusive opportunity to explore real ninjutsu techniques, deepen your understanding of Japanese culture, and immerse yourself in the spirit of the historical shinobi.",
